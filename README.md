# Gait Motion Modeling and Analysis

##  Dataset

We use the `138_HealthyPiG_10.05` dataset, which includes motion capture data from 138 able-bodied adults aged 21â€“86. These recordings utilize reflective markers placed at key anatomical locations, such as:

- Hip (e.g., RFEP, LFEP)  
- Knee (e.g., RFEO, LFEO)  
- Ankle (e.g., RTIO, LTIO)  
- Toe (e.g., RTOE, LTOE)  

These markers allow us to track the orientation and position of the hip, knee, ankle, and toe joints, enabling a detailed reconstruction of lower limb motion during walking.

Consistent marker placement across subjects ensures anatomical accuracy and reliability in downstream modeling.

Each participant has multiple trials named as:
- `SUB##_0`: Reference pose (subject standing still)  
- `SUB##_1`: Walking trial (left to right)  
- `SUB##_2`: Another walking trial, captured at a different time  

This naming structure helps maintain clarity across trials and simplifies automated processing for all 138 subjects.

##  Requirements

To run the Python scripts in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.8+
- Packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `scipy`
  - `ezc3d` (for loading `.c3d` motion capture files) 

Install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy ezc3d
```

## File Description:

#### 1. Motion_c3d.py
Usage: Visualizes the original motion captured in a .c3d file to serve as a reference for validating the reconstructed motion. Useful for comparing raw marker trajectories with model-generated results.

Output: Animates the actual recorded motion from the .c3d file.

#### 2. Motion-Modeling-for-CartesianSystem.py
Usage: Reconstructs gait motion using Cartesian coordinate transformations. Employs SE(3) matrices to model segmental movement through spatial transformations.

Output: Generates 3D segment positions, joint trajectories, and animated biomechanical visualizations.

#### 3. Motion-Modeling-for-PolarSystem.py
Usage: Models gait using polar (angular) coordinate systems. Computes spherical joint angles for key joints such as the hip, knee, and ankle.

Output: Produces joint trajectories, segment motion, and 3D animations from angular data for detailed biomechanical analysis.

#### 4. 138_HealthyPiG_10.05 copy.zip
A zipped dataset containing .c3d motion capture files for 138 able-bodied adult participants. Each subject includes:

SUB##_0: Static reference pose

SUB##_1 and SUB##_2: Walking trials recorded at different times

Markers are consistently placed to ensure anatomical accuracy and support reliable modeling across subjects.

#### 5. MAT_normalizedData_AbleBodiedAdults_v0.mat
A MATLAB .mat file that provides normalized gait cycle data for able-bodied individuals. It includes detailed information on:
Kinematics
Kinetics
Joint angles
This reference data is valuable for validating and comparing results generated by the modeling scripts.

#### Reproducing Results:

Run the below code line by line:
```bash
python Motion_c3d.py
python Motion-Modeling-for-CartesianSystem.py
python Motion-Modeling-for-PolarSystem.py
```
